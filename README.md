## Project Overview
The Loan Performance Dashboard is an end-to-end data analytics solution designed to help financial institutions monitor, analyze, and optimize their loan operations. The dashboard was built in **Power BI** and connected to a **SQL database** for real-time insights like loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower characteristics — enabling data-driven decision-making for improved operational efficiency.

##  Problem Statement
Banks need a clear way to monitor loan performance and borrower behavior to identify risk areas and improve decision-making.

---

##  Solution
- Used **SQL** to extract and calculate KPIs such as total applications, funded amount, repayments, and DTI.  
- Connected SQL data to **Power BI** and designed a **3-page dashboard**: Summary, Overview, and Details.  
- Created **DAX measures** to analyze MoM trends, loan health (good vs bad loans), and repayment performance.

---

## Key Insights
- Analyzed **38K+ loan applications** worth **$435M funded** and **$473M recovered**.  
- Found **86% good loans** and **14% bad loans**, helping identify potential risk zones.  
- Provided drill-down insights from high-level KPIs to loan-level details.
